# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I am creating this project after watching a crash lesson on C++. This will be my first leap into coding.

16 Jan 2020 - Today I created the Initial program. My next objective is to add a scoring system into the code. Then add a loop so that you can be asked if you want to play again.
